# Echoes of Culture — Final Project Proposal  

**Project Title:** Echoes of Culture  
**Team:** Echoes of Culture Collective  
**Duration:** ~5–6 weeks  
**Tools:** Python (Pygame, Processing.py, Tkinter), Pygame.mixer or PyAudio, JSON for cultural data, GitHub for collaboration  
**Prepared by:** Linh (Project Manager / Creative Director)

## 1. Executive Summary
Echoes of Culture is an interactive audiovisual installation celebrating cultural diversity through sound, motion, and digital storytelling.  
The experience reimagines a “living cultural sound map,” allowing users to awaken forgotten voices from different Asian cultures.  
Each interaction is an act of listening, healing, and remembrance—forming a global symphony that restores harmony across diversity.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Showcase cultural richness through an immersive interactive medium.  
- Merge coding, design, and sound art into one cohesive experience.  
- Raise awareness of cultural heritage through multisensory storytelling.  
- Encourage collaborative creation blending art and technology.

## 3. Creative Direction Overview
**Theme:** A Living Map of Memories  
**Core Concept:** Listening as healing — each user interaction revives a cultural echo.  
**Tone & Atmosphere:** Mystical, contemplative, restorative, and cross-sensory.  

**Narrative Arc:**  
1. *Silence* — The world falls into quiet; its songs sleep beneath time.  
2. *Discovery* — Touch reveals resonant cultural voices.  
3. *Awakening* — Rhythms return: bell, drum, wind, voice.  
4. *Harmony* — All sounds and visuals merge in balance.  
5. *Resolution* — The world hums again through your interaction.  

> “When you listen, the world breathes again.”

## 5. Project Features
1. Interactive audiovisual map triggering sound and motion.  
2. JSON-based structure storing cultural data (region, sound, color, keyword).  
3. Dynamic layering of sounds when multiple symbols triggered.  
4. Gradual evolution of color and rhythm by user interaction frequency.  
5. Ambient audio system blending multiple tracks in real time.

## 6. Art & Sound Identity
**Visual Language:**  
- Simplified cultural icons inspired by Asian heritage.  
- Warm gradients, organic motion, and meditative tones.  
- Visual harmony between animated shapes, colors, and rhythm.  

**Sound Identity:**  
- Use of traditional instrumental samples (drums, flutes, vocals, bells).  
- Ambient field layers (wind, water, chanting) for immersive effect.  
- Each action contributes a unique sonic layer to the global soundscape.

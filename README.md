# Echoes-of-Culture
An interactive audiovisual installation that celebrates cultural diversity through sound and motion. Users can explore an on-screen “cultural map” — clicking or hovering over different elements (patterns, instruments, symbols) triggers unique visuals and sounds, blending together into one collective symphony of cultures.

# Culturo

Culturo is an educational desktop application that helps primary and lower secondary students explore cultural diversity through interactive and gamified experiences. The app covers topics such as animals, language, performing arts, and cuisine from countries like Vietnam, Hong Kong, and China. The project aims to develop creative thinking, multicultural sensitivity, and a variety of skills through drawing, traditional greeting recordings, arts quizzes, and culinary questions.

**Note:** This is a new idea that replaces the previous Echoes-of-Culture proposal. The original proposal is retained in the repository for reference and to document the team’s development process.

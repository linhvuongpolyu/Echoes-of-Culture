## 1. General Discussion & Outcomes

- Videos of performances and detailed questions for each region have been collected.  
- Designs for app elements and logo have been created.  
- Code ensures separate parts function and has started exploring scoring and further API integration.  
- Wireframes are being optimized.  
- Feedback on videos:  
  1. Videos should be at least 1080p, horizontal, no watermark or credits, length around 45 seconds to 1 minute. Original links should be preserved for credit. Additional videos about food meeting the same criteria are needed.  
  2. Current questions are interesting but may be too challenging for children; consider rewriting based on selected videos for easier understanding.
